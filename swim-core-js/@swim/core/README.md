The **@swim/core** framework provides a lightweight, portable, dependency-free,
and strongly typed baseline on which to build higher level libraries.
**@swim/core** forms the foundation on which the
[**@swim/mesh**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-system-js/swim-mesh-js/@swim/mesh)
multiplexed streaming WARP framework, and the
[**@swim/ui**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-toolkit-js/swim-ui-js/@swim/ui)
real-time user interface toolkits, are built.  **@swim/core** is a part of the broader
[**@swim/system**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-system-js/@swim/system) framework.

## Framework

The **@swim/core** umbrella package depends on, and re-exports, the following
component libraries:

  ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swim/streamlet),
  [doc](https://docs.swimos.org/js/latest/modules/_swim_streamlet.html)) –
  stateful, streaming component model for application componets that
  continuously consume input state from streaming inlets, and continuously
  produce output state on streaming outlets.
- [**@swim/dataflow**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-system-js/swim-core-js/@swim/dataflow)
  ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swim/dataflow),
  [doc](https://docs.swimos.org/js/latest/modules/_swim_dataflow.html)) –
  compiler from **@swim/structure** expressions to live-updated data models.
- [**@swim/recon**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-system-js/swim-core-js/@swim/recon)

  with `strptime`/`strftime`-style parsers and formatters.

**@swim/core** has no external dependencies.

## Installation

### npm

For an npm-managed project, `npm install @swim/core` to make it a dependency.
TypeScript sources will be installed into `node_modules/@swim/core/main`.
Transpiled JavaScript and TypeScript definition files install into
`node_modules/@swim/core/lib/main`.  And a pre-built UMD script, which
bundles all **@swim/core** component libraries, can be found in
`node_modules/@swim/core/dist/main/swim-core.js`.

### Browser

Browser applications can load `swim-core.js` directly from the SwimOS CDN.

```html
<!-- Development -->
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-core.js"></script>

<!-- Production -->
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-core.min.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, the standalone `swim-system.js` script may be loaded
from the SwimOS CDN, which bundles **@swim/core** together with all other
[**@swim/system**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-system-js/@swim/system)
frameworks.

```html
<!-- Development -->
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-system.js"></script>

<!-- Production -->
<script src="https://cdn.swimos.org/js/latest/swim-system.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

### ES6/TypeScript

**@swim/core** can be imported as an ES6 module from TypeScript and other
ES6-compatible environments.  All component libraries are re-exported by
the umbrella `@swim/core` module.

```typescript
import * as swim from "@swim/core";
```

### CommonJS/Node.js

**@swim/core** can also be used as a CommonJS module in Node.js applications.
All component libraries are re-exported by the umbrella `@swim/core` module.

```javascript
var swim = require("@swim/core");
```

### Browser

When loaded by a web browser, the `swim-core.js` script adds all component
library exports to the global `swim` namespace.

The `swim-system.js` script also adds all **@swim/core** component library
exports to the global `swim` namespace, making it a drop-in replacement
for `swim-core.js` when additional **@swim/system** frameworks are needed.

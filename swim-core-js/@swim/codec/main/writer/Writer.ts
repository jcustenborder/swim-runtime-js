/**
 * Continuation of how to write subsequent [[Output]] tokens to a stream.
 * `Writer` enables efficient, interruptible writing of network protocols and
 * data formats, without intermediate buffering.
 *
 * ### Output tokens
 * A `Writer` writes tokens to an `Output` writer.  Output tokens are modeled
 * as primitive numbers, commonly representing Unicode code points, or raw
 * octets.  Each `Writer` implementation specifies the semantic type of output
 * tokens it produces.
 *
 * ### Writer states
 * A `Writer` is always in one of three states: _cont_â€‹inue, _done_, or _error_.
 * The _cont_ state indicates that [[pull]] is ready to produce `Output`; the
 * _done_ state indicates that writing terminated successfully, and that
 * [[bind]] will return the written result; the _error_ state indicates that
 * writing terminated in failure, and that [[trap]] will return the write error.
 * `Writer` subclasses default to the _cont_ state.
 *
 * ### Feeding input
 * The [[feed]] method returns a `Writer` that represents the continuation
 * of how to write the given input object to subsequent `Output` writers.
 * `feed` can be used to specify an initial object to write, or to change
 * the object to be written.
 *
 * ### Pulling output
 * The [[pull]] method incrementally writes as much `Output` as it can, before
 * returning another `Writer` that represents the continuation of how to write
 * additional `Output`.  The `Output` passed to `pull` is only guaranteed to be
 * valid for the duration of the method call; references to the provided
 * `Output` instance must not be stored.
 *
 * ### Writer results
 * A `Writer` produces a written result of type `O`, obtained via the [[bind]]
 * method.  `bind` is only guaranteed to return a result when in the _done_
 * state; though `bind` may optionally make available partial results in other
 * states.  A failed `Writer` provides a write error via the [[trap]] method.
 * `trap` is only guaranteed to return an error when in the _error_ state.
 *
 * ### Continuations
 * A `Writer` instance represents a continuation of how to write remaining
 * `Output`.  Rather than writing a complete output in one go, a `Writer` takes
 * an `Output` chunk and returns another `Writer` instance that knows how to
 * write subsequent `Output` chunks.  This enables non-blocking, incremental
 * writing that can be interrupted whenever an `Output` writer runs out of
 * space.  A `Writer` terminates by returning a continuation in either the
 * _done_ state, or the _error_ state.  [[Writer.done]] returns a `Writer` in
 * the _done_ state.  [[Writer.error]] returns a `Writer` in the _error_ state.
 *
 * ### Forking
 * The [[fork]] method passes an out-of-band condition to a `Writer`, yielding
 * a `Writer` continuation whose behavior may be altered by the given condition.
 * For example, a console `Writer` might support a `fork` condition that changes
 * the color and style of printed text.  The types of conditions accepted by
 * `fork`, and their intended semantics, are implementation defined.

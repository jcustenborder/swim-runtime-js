/**
 * A hashed generational cache set discards the least recently used value
 * with the worst hit rate per hash bucket.  HashGenCacheSet is a concurrent
 * and lock-free LRFU cache, with O(1) access time.
 *
 * Maintaining four "generations" of cached values per hash bucket, the cache
 * discards from the younger generations based on least recent usage, and
 * promotes younger generations to older generations based on most frequent
 * usage.  Cache misses count as negative usage of the older generations,
 * biasing the cache against least recently used values with poor hit rates.
 *
 * The cache soft references the older generations, and weak references the
 * younger generations; the garbage collector can reclaim the entire cache,
 * but will preferentially wipe the younger cache generations before the older
 * cache generations.
